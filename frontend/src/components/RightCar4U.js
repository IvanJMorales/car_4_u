              Some users don’t really have a specific car in mind, 
              but just want to buy a car because it's time. 
              There are many great options such as Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Hyundai, 
              and others that are affordable, last many years, 
              don’t break down so easily, and are the perfect 
              types of car to get started with. We can have a basic 
              filter that gives them such options as well as basic needs such 
              as heating, air conditioning, trunk space, number of miles per 
              gallon, whether the car is electric or hybrid or combustion 
              engine. Our user will be delighted to know that they won’t have 
              to search individually anymore, but have all those options right by their fingertips.

              Some users may want a luxurious car with great horsepower as well, 
              but more impressive for taking a lady out on a date. That car can be a Mercedes, 
              BMW, Audi, Infiniti, or any other similar car with leather seats, V6 or V8 engine, 
              tinted windows, and makes loud noises when it drives. By filtering out cars with 
              tinted windows, luxury category, price, color, and horsepower which makes the car 
              roam louder when it drives faster, our user will be happy to know they have so many 
              varieties to choose from and can narrow it down with any more specific details that 
              they would like.

              Our project allows the user to filter out what exactly they want in their 
              car or how it performs, which then filters through various databases from 
              different car companies and compares the best options for them. For example,
              a user may own a construction company and needs a strong, sturdy truck that 
              has great trunk space, and is capable of driving in heavy snow, rain, and even 
              withstand hail. The user will instantly have access to many different trucks with 
              the features and specs they need their truck to be able to have, as well as price 
              range, mileage, capability, and horsepower.
