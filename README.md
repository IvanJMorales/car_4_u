For our Capstone Project, we decided to create a Python based data scraper that pulls data from multiple car sale websites and presents this data in an easily accessible web app created using React. Users can search through our Firestore database to find a car they are specifically looking for and can compare cars if they find
multiple they are interested in, even if both cars are hosted on different car sales websites.
